Form Name: FamilyScheduleForm


5. How to Use It (Step-by-Step)

✅ Step 1: Launch the Form

From the main dashboard, click Family Schedule.

✅ Step 2: Fill in the Details

Title (TextBox): Enter the event title (e.g., “School Trip”).

Notes (TextBox): Additional remarks (e.g., “Bring lunch and water”).

DateOfEvent (DateTimePicker): Select the date.

StartTime / EndTime (DateTimePickers): Enter start and end times.

AssignedTo (ComboBox): Select family member responsible or attending.

EventType (ComboBox): Choose from:

Birthdays

Chores

Doctor’s Visit

School Trip

Meal

Task

Personal


> 💡 Selecting Doctor’s Visit or School Trip will highlight the day on the calendar when the child is scheduled to attend.


✅ Step 3: Save or Modify Event

[Save]: Adds a new event to the database.

[Update]: Changes the selected event.

[Delete]: Removes the selected event from the list.


✅ Step 4: Filter or Refresh

[Filter Chores, Meal Plans, and Tasks]: Click this button to show only relevant items.

Events like Chore, Meal, and Task will remain; others will be hidden.


[Refresh]: Reloads the full list of scheduled events and resets filters.


✅ Step 5: View Results

Events appear in the DataGridView.

Selected dates with scheduled events are bolded in the MonthCalendar.

If a conflict exists (e.g., overlapping times), a warning appears:

> “Conflict detected: ‘Laundry’ overlaps with ‘School Trip’.”


6. Things to Note

StartTime must be before EndTime.

You can’t edit or delete completed tasks.

Filtering only shows chores, meals, and tasks—use Refresh to return to full view.

Birthdays and doctor visits are informational—conflict detection doesn’t block them but shows a warning if overlap occurs.
