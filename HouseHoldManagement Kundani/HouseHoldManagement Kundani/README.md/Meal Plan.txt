 Description

 
The Meal Plan feature helps users create, manage, and view planned meals for the household. It allows selecting meals based on category, setting start and end dates, tracking total calories, and uploading a related image. This helps households manage diets, plan meals in advance, and reduce grocery waste by integrating with the Inventory and Grocery features.
